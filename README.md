dfa-runner
==========

This is a crate for executing deterministic finite automata. So far it's a slight clean-up of things extracted from [regex-dfa](https://github.com/jneem/regex-dfa). Eventually, that code will be removed from `regex-dfa`, which will use the implementation in this crate instead.
